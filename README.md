# i - A command line tool for writing journal entries

## Installation
Clone this repository
`git clone https://github.com/jimbert/i`

Run `sh setup.sh`

## Usage
You can log an activity with a simple command line command.

Example: 

```
i created a new repository for a project called 'i'
```

This will log to a predefined text file. This will eventually be made flexible so you can set the location of your log file to something better, like a dropbox folder?
